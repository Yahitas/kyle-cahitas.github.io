One advantage of the x100v lies in its film simulation capabilities. For these shots, I installed the Fujicolor Superia 800 film simulation, which proves to be ideal for overcast days. It renders a hazy and cool palette of green and blue tones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStairway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPathway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoulters Matilija Poppy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalina Island Live-forever"
