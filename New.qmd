I captured these images using the Fujifilm x100v, a newly acquired camera that really lives up to its hype. One advantage of the x100v lies in its film simulation capabilities. For these shots, I installed the Fujicolor Superia 800 film simulation, which proves to be ideal for overcast days. It renders a hazy and cool palette of green and blue tones.
